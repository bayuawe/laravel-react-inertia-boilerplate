# TODO: Replace hardcoded user data in dashboard with logged-in user data

-   [x] Edit app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard.php to pass authenticated user to Inertia view
-   [x] Edit resources/js/Pages/Dashboard.jsx to retrieve user from props and pass to AppSidebar
-   [x] Edit resources/js/Components/app-sidebar.jsx to accept user prop and use it instead of hardcoded data
